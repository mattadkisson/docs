# Health monitoring

Monitoring of the status and performance of a SmartSpace system over time

## Summary

Recording and analyzing system health is often a requirement for enterprise
location system deployments. Ubisense Health monitoring works by periodically
delivering metrics to a central health monitoring service. Separate services
expose these measurements to an external metrics database system such as
Prometheus. Metrics can then be viewed on configurable dashboards in a web
browser. Isolation of monitoring from the operation of the SmartSpace platform
ensures a minimal impact on system performance.

## Benefits

Benefits of Health monitoring are:

  * Proactive support  
Threshold conditions can be set to trigger support before the system fails

  * Swifter fault diagnosis  
The availability of recorded health data can speed up the diagnosis and
correction of issues  

  * Modularity and scalability  
The modular health monitoring architecture composes with the particular
SmartSpace features you license and can scale to large volumes of recorded
data

  * Visibility   
Use of web-based configurable dashboards brings metrics to users in an easily-
accessible format
