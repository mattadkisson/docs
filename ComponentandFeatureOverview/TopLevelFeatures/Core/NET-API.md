# .NET API

![](../../../images/DotNetLogo.png)

Exchange configuration and real-time data with third-party systems

## Summary

The .NET API is a client-side library that uses the proprietary Ubisense
protocols to communicate directly with the SmartSpace Core services. It
supports the development of programs to:

  * Change or retrieve SmartSpace configuration information, such as names, spatial properties, cell hierarchy, service management
  * Exchange real-time data with SmartSpace, for example receiving or injecting real-time-location events or spatial relationships

The .NET API is primarily targeted at Windows installations.
