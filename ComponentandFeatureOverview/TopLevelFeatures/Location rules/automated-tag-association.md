# Automated tag association

Associate tags to products using location data from tags

## Summary

In production environments, if a product is to be tagged its tag is normally
attached early in the product's lifecycle and subsequently removed when the
product is completed. Automated tag association allows the user to place and
configure association objects and disassociation objects. When a product and a
tag are both positioned at an association object, the tag is associated to the
product; similarly when the tagged product is positioned at a disassociation
object, its tag is removed. This provides a way of managing tag-to-product
association that is much less error-prone and more efficient than a manual
configuration process. Automated tag association has been used for many years
in large-scale production environments to associate and remove hundreds of
tags every day.

If the [Visibility](../../TopLevelComponents/visibility.htm) component is also
licensed, SmartSpace provides a browser-based interface to display automated
association status data.
