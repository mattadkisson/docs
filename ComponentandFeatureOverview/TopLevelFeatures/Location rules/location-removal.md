# Location removal

Provides a mechanism by which the current location of an object is removed

## Summary

The location removal feature is similar to tag removal and object deletion
supported via assertions in SmartSpace core. Location removal allows an
assertion to be made that causes the current location of the object to be
removed, and the assertion will be reset once this has been done.
