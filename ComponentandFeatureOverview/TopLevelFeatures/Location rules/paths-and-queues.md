# Paths and queues

Definition of fixed paths along which objects travel, snapping of located
objects to paths, and the application of constraints to form queues

## Summary

The purpose of Paths and queues is to allow you to introduce prior knowledge
of object locations into SmartSpace, in particular when objects travel along
fixed paths.

With Paths and queues in control, objects will be snapped to nearby paths as
tags move around. Configuration intended to match the real-world, physical,
immutable constraints of the objects being modeled, such as speed and
separation, ensures that objects form queues along the paths. The object
sequence information in your application can be used to report things like
“number of vehicles in front”.
