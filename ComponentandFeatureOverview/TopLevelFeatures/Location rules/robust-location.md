# Robust location

Detection of an object's location at a given place using strong evidence,
including distance and speed, to be robust to transient process errors

## Summary

An assertion point detects when an object is located at a given place using
strong evidence, including distance and speed. This allows the point to be
robust to transient process errors in production, such as carrying assets
close to a gate location.
