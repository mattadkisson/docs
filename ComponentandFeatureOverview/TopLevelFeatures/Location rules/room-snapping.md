# Room snapping

Consistently snap object locations within rooms

## Summary

Room snapping consistently locates objects within defined areas called rooms
by snapping them a defined distance inside the room's boundary until the
object has completely left the room. It allows a clean exit through
doorways—areas at the perimeter of rooms where snapping is disabled. Rooms and
doorways exist within buildings which can be defined to reflect the physical
layout of a site.

Room snapping eliminates through wall error where tagged objects close to the
edge of a defined area are incorrectly located.
