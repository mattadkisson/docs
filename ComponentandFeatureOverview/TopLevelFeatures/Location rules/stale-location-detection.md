# Stale location detection

Monitor streams of location events for tagged objects and detect out-of-date
location data

## Summary

Stale location detection can be configured, for any individual object, with a
maximum delay between expected location events for that object; it monitors
the location event stream for configured objects, detects when objects are no
longer receiving up-to-date location information, and asserts that they are
stale. These stale assertions can then be used by third-party systems, via the
[.NET API](../Core/NET-API.htm) or the [C++ API](../Core/C-plus-plus-API.htm),
or by logic configured using the [Business
rules](../../TopLevelComponents/business-rules.htm) component (if the Business
rules component is also licensed).
