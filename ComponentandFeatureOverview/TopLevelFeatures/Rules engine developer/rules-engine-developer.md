# Rules engine developer

User tools for programming the Business rules engine

## Summary

The Business rules engine allows complex logic and relationships between
objects to be defined. The user specifies these rules by using graphical
programming techniques.

## Features

Defining important events or actions within an application requires a way to
describe:

  * The conditions under which an event has become true
  * The actions that must occur when the prerequisite conditions have been satisfied

The easiest way to describe such constructs is through language. SmartSpace
offers a rule and event definition interface that allows the user to drag and
drop objects, properties and relations and join them together to create
language-like structures.

The Rules engine developer also includes tools for the import and export of
rules to allow developers to ship reusable packages of rules to other sites or
customers and to manage development projects using standard version control
systems.
