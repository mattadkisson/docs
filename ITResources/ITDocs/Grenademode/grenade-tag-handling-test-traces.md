## Test traces

### Test 1: Multiple failed attempts to ack a tag (due to misconfiguration)

This test shows the tag being processed by 07:95. Both sensors 'see' the tag
UWB and there is a random choice between them to determine the ack-ing sensor.
This comes out for 07:95 three times. Each of these ack attempts (msg count =
40, 43, 46) causes a warning message to be generated because the 07:95 radio
has not been configured (and the attempt fails). The fourth time the other
sensor 06:F0 is selected and this sends an ack to the tag at msg count 49, but
this doesn't get transmitted until too late and the tag has not received the
acknowledgement at msg count = 50 and therefore the status 50 gets sent to the
tag status service.

Tag 1 powered up, button pressed, tracked, acknowledged, but ack not received

### Test 2: Successful ack of the tag

This is the same configuration as (1) but in this case the sensor 06:F0 is
selected for the first ack attempt and the tag is successfully ack-ed.

Tag 1 powered up, button pressed, tracked, acknowledged, ack received

### Test 3: Successful ack of two tags simultaneously

Using the correct radio configuration for both sensors (to improve radio
reliability) we show two tags being ack-ed simultaneously. Note that both
final values are 306 which is 1 ack + 50 messages, demonstrating that each tag
only heard one ack message (the one destined for it).

Tag 1 and 2 powered up, button pressed, tracked, acknowledged, but ack not
received
