# Example of ACS with message forwarding with the ACS Protocol

Demonstration of ACS with Message Forwarding with the ACS Protocol.

Preparing of the Ubisense Platform including: Area, Region and Cells.

Configuration of ACS including: Workspaces, External Systems and Device Types.

Show Simulations of the ACS Protocol and the Ubisense Service Manager.

## Preparation of your Environment

Follow the installations instructions for the combination of SmartSpace and
ACS and other Ubisense products you require as described in your installation
guide.

## Use SmartSpace Config to Set up a Site and Add Representations for your
Demonstration

Follow the instructions for configuring ACS given in [Configuration in
SmartSpace](../../../UserResources/ACS/acs-configuration.htm).

In particular, you must do the following.

### Site Setup

  1. Create a new Area.
  2. Add a Geometry Cell to your site.
  3. Add a Location Cell to your Geometry Cell.
  4. Extend your Location Cell. In the Cells task, double-click the location cell and, in the Edit the extent of Location Cell dialog, change the Top to 10.
  5. Extend your Geometry Cell and Site Cell to contain your Location Cell.

Restart the Location Management Services in the Ubisense Service Manager in
order to make sure that the services are running correctly.

## Configuration in ACS

### Add a Workspace in ACS

See Workspaces in the ACS Online Help.

  1. Choose your Area.
  2. Set a suitable name (e.g. "Battery assembly").
  3. For Height of floor [m] set "0".
  4. For Height of ceiling [m] set "2".
  5. Set a suitable geometry for your Workspace.
  6. Commit your changes.

### Configure an External System

See External Systems in the ACS Online Help.

  1. Set a suitable name.
  2. As Type choose _Tool Control._
  3. Set a suitable description.

### Add a Device

See Device Types in the ACS Online Help.

  1. Set a suitable device name (e.g. _Battery Assembly Tool_).
  2. Add a suitable description.

### Add a Device Instance

See Device Instances in the ACS Online Help.

  1. Set a suitable name (e.g. _BA Device_).
  2. As Device Type choose _BatteryAssemblyTool_ (the type you created in the previous step).
  3. As External System name choose _ACSToolController_ (the external system you last created).
  4. Set an Association ID.
  5. Commit your changes.

### Enable Static Space rules

See Device Instances (Setting Static Space Rules) in the ACS Online Help.

  1. Select your created device.
  2. Select Enable static space rules.
  3. Set Enable Device to _Yes_ for your Static Space.

### Enable Message Forwarding

See Message Forwarding in the ACS Online Help.

  * Select your configured External System for Message Forwarding.

ACS is now configured.

## Simulate the ACS Protocol

For your Demonstration there is a tool you can use to simulate the ACS
Protocol.

In order to see any output at the cmd you must set an Environment variable,
otherwise you can see the output only in the log-File  
set UABASEEVENTLOG=1.

### Simulate the ACSProtocol

With the tool ubisense_acs_protocol_clientserver.exe you can display the
product types moving along your assembly line. You can find it in the tools
directory.

How to use:

ubisense_acs_protocol_clientserver.exe server <IP-Address> <Port> 1

For example:

ubisense_acs_protocol_clientserver.exe server 192.168.178.201 4646 1

### Use the Ubisense Service Manager to Start and Stop the ACSProtocol

At the command line from ubisense_acs_protocol_clientserver.exe you will see a
telegram each time the ACSProtocol is stopped. You can also see these
telegrams in the corresponding Log-File (ubisense_acs_protocol_service*.log).
