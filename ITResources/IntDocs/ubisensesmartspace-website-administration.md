# SmartSpace Website Admin Features

Instructions for accessing admin features of the SmartSpace website, and
adding users and businesses

To access these features you need to have administrator access to the site.

## Accessing the admin features

To get to the admin features of the SmartSpace website:

  1. Open the website: [http://www.ubisensesmartspace.com](http://www.ubisensesmartspace.com).
  2. Log in.
  3. Go to [http://www.ubisensesmartspace.com/admin](http://www.ubisensesmartspace.com/admin).

(You’ll need to type the admin bit into the URL.)

If you get an access denied message, you haven’t been given the admin role.

You’ll see the following screen:

## Adding users

You need to associate a user with a business, so if you’re not sure there’s
one set up for the user, check first. See Adding businesses, below.

To add a user, click on Users and then click on CREATE A NEW USER ENTITY.

You see the following form:

Features_1_623x276.png)

Add the user’s details and select the business and role from the dropdowns.
(How long the user has access to the site is determined by the business you
associate them with; what they see is determined by their role.)

For businesses, you select one of the businesses set up in the Businesses
form.

For role, you can select:

administrator |  everything on the site  
---|---  
ubisense |  all content on the site; no access to admin functions  
partner |   
customer |  description of components and features plus installation and configuration information and other content deemed necessary for users  
general |  description of components and features only  
  
(These settings are controlled in the Roles screen.)

When you click Save, an email is sent inviting the new user to collect their
password for the site.

Note: There is no delete option. If you need to remove a user, you can set
their business to Deleted (a dummy business with an expired access date) and
their access will be blocked.

## Adding businesses

If you need to add a new business, click on Businesses and then click on
CREATE A NEW BUSINESS ENTITY.

You’ll see the following form.

![screenshot of create businesss form](../../images/SmartSpace Website Admin
Features_2_624x203.png)

Give the business a name, and an expiry date for access to the site. For
businesses requiring general access, set the expiry for 12 months from adding
the entity. Customers’ access ought to tie into licensing.

## Reports

There is a single report, accessed via the Reports menu: Users not
authenticated displays users whose details are in the system but who have not
logged into the site.

## Troubleshooting

Occasionally users may experience problems during the creation of their login.
Generally they hit these problems:

  1. After a new user entry has been created, the user didn't receive an email with the password link.

![Closed](../../images/transparent.gif)Suggested solutions

1\. The email may have arrived and been marked as spam. Suggest the user
checks their spam/junk email folder.

2\. The email may have been blocked by a highly-secure corporate firewall.
Suggest the user switches to a different email address (Gmail works fine for
this) and set up a new login for them with the alternative email.

  1. The new user received an email with the password link but failed to access the password page.

![Closed](../../images/transparent.gif)Suggested solutions

1\. Remember it's one time only, so if they try the same email a second time,
it won't work. Suggest a password reset instead.

2\. Try a different email address (in case the corporate firewall is
interfering with the signup process).

## Other admin features

### Roles

This is where the website content is associated with the defined roles. For a
selected role, it shows a list of all the content directories in the site and
whether they’re available to the role.

In general, any content in the following folders or their subfolders is
associated with these roles:

Content/ComponentandFeatureOverview |  all  
---|---  
Content/ITResources/IntDocs |  ubisense, admin  
Content/ITresources/ITDocs  |  customer, (partner), ubisense, admin  
Content/ITresources/PartnerResourcess  |  partner, ubisense, admin – currently unused  
Content/UserResources  |  customer, (partner), ubisense, admin  
  
This shouldn’t need changing between updates of the website.

### New System

Clicking this uploads a new version of the website previously prepared for
publishing. You don’t need to use this for user admin!
