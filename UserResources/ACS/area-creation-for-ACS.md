# Creating areas for use in ACS

In ACS, areas are used to partition the site model. Usually an area will
represent some complete, but relatively self-contained region of the site,
such as one floor of a building, or one functional area of a large floor.
Before you can use areas in ACS, you must define them in SmartSpace Config.
There are several stages to this: creating areas as instances of the
Generation2 Area object type and defining the spatial extents associated with
them. Once defined, you can add the areas to ACS.

You can also retrieve areas currently defined in ACS for modification in
SmartSpace.

### Creating a new area object

To create a new area:

  1. In SmartSpace Config, click TYPES / OBJECTS to open the Types and objects workspace.
  2. Drag the Generation2 Area object type from the Types list into the Object Browser workspace.
  3. Choose <Create new object>.
  4. Give the area a unique name.

You do not need to change any other properties.

  5. Click Save.

### Adding a spatial extent to an area

To add a spatial extent to the area:

  1. In SmartSpace Config click SPATIAL PROPERTIES to open the Spatial properties workspace
  2. Select Generation2 Area from the <Select a type> dropdown.
  3. Select extent from the <Select a property> dropdown.

All areas with specific spaces already defined are listed.

spaces-for-areas.png)

  4. Choose <Create new specific space>.
  5. Select an area from the Choose an object dropdown.

Only areas without a defined specific space are listed.

  6. Define the extent for the area. See [Configure space properties of types](../BuildandCreate/SpatialRelations/spatial-properties-configuration.htm#Configur) for information how to define the extent of an object.

     * Select the Generation2 Area extent check box to highlight all areas with defined spatial extents.
  7. Click Save.

When you have defined all your site's areas you can copy them to ACS.

### Copying areas to a Generation 2.X program

To copy areas to ACS:

  1. In SmartSpace Config click SPATIAL PROPERTIES.
  2. Select Generation2 Area from the <Select a type> dropdown.
  3. Select extent from the <Select a property> dropdown.

All areas with specific spaces already defined are listed.

  4. Choose Push areas to Generation2.X.
