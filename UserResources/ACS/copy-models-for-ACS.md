All objects listed in the dialog will be imported into ACS. However, only
those whose names end in _template will be offered as representations when
defining product types.

  3. Click the Copy models... button and the files are copied to ACS.

When the operation is complete, the dialog closes and you are returned to the
Model assignment workspace.
