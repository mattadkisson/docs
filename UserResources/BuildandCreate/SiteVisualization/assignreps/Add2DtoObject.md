# Assigning a 2D representation to an object

## Adding a representation to a type (SLIGHTLY MODIFY AND DUPLICATE THIS
SECTION FOR CORE vs WORKER – RAE TALK TO JON)

To add a representation for a type:

  1. Double-click <Add new type rep>.
  2. Choose the object type.
  3. Choose the representation from the list of imported reps.
  4. Add a name for the representation mode. Leave this as <default> if:
    1. You are working with 3D reps
    2. You don’t intend to change your object representation programmatically (using the Business rules engine)
  5. Click Save.
  6. Use the check boxes displayed beside the new details for your object and representation pair to control how and where the representation assignment you’ve just created is used. There are two options:  
Show in 2D: tells SmartSpace you want this representation/rep mode pair to be
visible for this class of object when they are displayed in the Web Map  
Show in 3D: tells SmartSpace you want this representation/rep mode pair to be
visible for this class of object when they are displayed in the 3D site
visualization

Only the ‘<default>’ rep mode gets rendered to the 3D site visualization, so
any other rep modes here will be ignored by the system.
