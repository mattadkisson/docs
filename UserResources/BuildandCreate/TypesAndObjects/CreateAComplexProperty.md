# Creating a complex property

To create a new complex property, click on TYPES / OBJECTS to open the Types
and objects workspace and double-click <Create new complex property>.

This will display the Create a new property dialog where you can input the
definition.

  1. From the dropdown, choose the required type for the new property. This can be:

     * a data storage type of bool, string, time, int or double.
     * a custom type.
  2. For non-Boolean properties, you can require each value to be unique by checking whose value must be unique.
  3. Construct a statement using the Key text fields and types selected from the Key argument dropdowns.

As you create the statement, a summary is built at the bottom of the dialog.

  4. Click Save

Once added, complex property definitions cannot be edited in SmartSpace
Config. You can delete a complex property by selecting it, pressing Delete,
and confirming the deletion.

Dragging a complex property into the Object browser allows you to see when new
rows of data are added. You can also add new rows manually, for example when
testing.
