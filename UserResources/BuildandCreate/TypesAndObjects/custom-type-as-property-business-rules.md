# Adding a custom type as a property

When any of the Visibility, Business rules, Reporting or Applications
integration components have been licensed, it is possible to add any number of
additional, custom properties to an Object Type using the Business object
properties feature. Types and objects and their properties are created using
the SmartSpace Config application. You can find a description of the workspace
for creating types and objects in [Configure SmartSpace](../smartspace-config-
intro.htm). The instructions below take you through creating one custom type
for use as a property of another.

An example would be to create a new custom Type called Quality Note and add it
as a property to a Wing object Type.

Start by creating a custom Type called Quality Note:

type](../../../images/3_5-business-object-properties.png)

Add a selection of Properties to this new Type:

type](../../../images/3_5-business-object-properties-1.png)

You can now add the Quality Note type as a custom property of the Wing Type:
