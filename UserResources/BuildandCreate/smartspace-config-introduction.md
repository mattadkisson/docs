Configuring SmartSpace

## Configuration

The SmartSpace Config application provides you with the workspaces to set up
types and objects; work with representations; define spatial relationships;
create searches; and configure users and roles.

Run SmartSpace Config from the Start menu, and access the workspaces by
clicking on the tabs on the left-hand side of the application window.
