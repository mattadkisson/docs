# SmartSpace Config Online Help

The SmartSpace Config application allows you to configure your SmartSpace
installation. Tasks you might need to undertake include:

  * setting up types and objects to build your data model
  * defining spatial relationships for types and objects
  * working with graphical representations of your site and objects within it
  * creating searches for use with web maps and web forms
  * managing users' access to parts of SmartSpace

SmartSpace Config provides various tabs in the left-hand part of the screen
which are listed in the order in which you are likely to complete your
configuration tasks.

You can access only tabs associated with features you have licensed.

For further information about the fundamental concepts behind SmartSpace and
the features it offers, see the SmartSpace website at
