# Configuring Reporting

As part of the process of configuring reporting, Location and property history
in SmartSpace Config is used to:

  * Configure and test the connection from SmartSpace to an SQL Server or Oracle database
  * Configure logging of required properties. The mode of logging determines what happens in the database when the property values are changed, and how long they are retained

You can find a description of the workspace in SmartSpace Config in [Location
and property history](../BuildandCreate/location-and-property-history-
configuration.htm). For a full explanation of how to connect SmartSpace to a
database and configure logging, see [Configuring Reporting](reporting-
developer.htm#ConRep1).
