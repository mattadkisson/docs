# C++ API

Exchange configuration and real-time data with third-party systems

## Summary

The C++ API is a client-side library that uses the proprietary Ubisense protocols to communicate directly with the SmartSpace Core services.

## Features

The C++ API supports the development of programs to:

* Change or retrieve SmartSpace configuration information such as names, spatial properties, cell hierarchy, service management
* Exchange real-time data with SmartSpace, for example receiving or injecting real-time-location events or spatial relationships

The C++ API is available for Windows (Win32) and Linux applications.

The C++ API uses the same code that has been proven in large-scale mission- critical real-time control systems for over a decade. It is only recommended for users familiar with C++ programming because it requires an understanding of important C++ principles such as RAII.
