## Summary

The .NET API is a client-side library that uses the proprietary Ubisense protocols to communicate directly with the SmartSpace Core services. It supports the development of programs to:

* Change or retrieve SmartSpace configuration information, such as names, spatial properties, cell hierarchy, service management
* Exchange real-time data with SmartSpace, for example receiving or injecting real-time-location events or spatial relationships

The .NET API is primarily targeted at Windows installations.
