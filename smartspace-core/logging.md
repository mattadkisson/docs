# Logging

Cellular service-based logging of trace messages and DIMENSION4 location
events

[More about Logging](../../../UserResources/BuildandCreate/Logging/logging-
configuration.htm)

## Summary

The logging services are designed for always-on and scalable logging of the
SmartSpace system. They can be configured to run on a dedicated logging
server, or be split between multiple logging servers for maximum scalability.
The services ensure that only a configured maximum disk space on each logging
server is used. Trace messages are logged from all Ubisense programs. Location
messages are logged from DIMENSION4 sensors. The logging services support
listening in real time and the retrieval of historical messages. There are GUI
components supporting these features for both trace messages and location
events and a command-line utility for retrieving trace messages for use with
standard command-line text manipulation tools.
