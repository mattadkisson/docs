## Summary

The logging services are designed for always-on and scalable logging of the SmartSpace system. They can be configured to run on a dedicated logging server, or be split between multiple logging servers for maximum scalability. The services ensure that only a configured maximum disk space on each logging server is used. Trace messages are logged from all Ubisense programs. Location messages are logged from DIMENSION4 sensors. The logging services support listening in real time and the retrieval of historical messages. There are GUI components supporting these features for both trace messages and location events and a command-line utility for retrieving trace messages for use with standard command-line text manipulation tools.
