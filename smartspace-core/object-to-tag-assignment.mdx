# Object to tag assignment

Manually assign tags to objects using the SmartSpace configuration client

## Summary

Tags can be assigned to objects using the SmartSpace configuration client. The offset of the tag from the origin of the object can be defined per type. For example, if the tag is attached to a car's windscreen the offset from the origin can be set for cars.

Tags can be assigned to objects manually, one object at a time. The tag identifier must be typed in by hand and the object and tag position selected from drop-down lists.

Valid ranges of tags can be specified and associated with object types. An attempt to assign a tag which is outside the valid range for the objectâ€™s type will result in an error.
