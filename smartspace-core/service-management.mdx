## Summary

SmartSpace uses a Service-Oriented Architecture. Each SmartSpace installation
comprises a few dozen separate services that map onto executable programs on a
single machine or a set of communicating machines. This provides scalable
real-time performance. Service management provides centralized control for the
set of services in a system. It supports service installation and upgrade,
assignment of services to machines, and service backup.

Service management provides a status screen running on the Windows operating
system showing real-time status of all services along with support for
installing, upgrading and removing services.
