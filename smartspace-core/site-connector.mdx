Connect Ubisense platforms on separate networks using TCP/IP, either for multi-site operation, or for support purposes

## Summary

Site connector has two related uses.

It can connect together distributed computers on disjoint networks, via a TCP/IP connection, so they appear to be connected to the same Ubisense platform. In this role, Site connector has been used to connect production sites around Europe to a single central platform.

Site connector can also be used to connect client computers to a platform when
the network configuration prevents direct connection, such as for remote
access support via a VPN.
